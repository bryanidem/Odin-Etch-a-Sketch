# Etch a sketch

This is the project description from the Odin project.

> In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

In this project I learned a lot about DOM manipulation, and events in javascript. I still dont enjoy how the JS code ended up, i think it should be more clean, or structurized, i feel that everything is all over the place.

Also I learned about the `<dialog>` tag. It was a game changer for me, since it allowed me to create modal boxes without speding too much time, but we need to be careful to add a the display property to it, since much of the functionality is lost. I found that using a `div.container` does the trick.

I implemented everything as I planned, so im proud of being able to envisioned something and make it a reality.
